	<h2><u>My Sister's Keeper</u></h2><br />
	<p>
	<img src="img/Sisters-keeper.jpg"><br />
	</p>.
	<p>
	This is one of my favorite books because it shows how<br /> hard it is for a child to be pressured into doing something<br /> they don't want to do. It also shows how one decision can impact <br />many people at once.<br />

	<h2><u>If I stay</u></h2><br />
	<p>
	<img src="img/If-I-Stay.jpg" width=300px><br />
	</p>
	<p>
	This is another one of my favorite because it is about a <br />girl who lost everything and was struggling with the decision of whether <br />she had anything worth living for anymore. It showed how <br />hard it was for her to make this decision and all the thoughts that came to mind.<br />

	<h2><u>Handle With Care</u></h2><br />
	<p>
	<img src="img/handle-with-care.jpg" width=300px><br />
	</p>
	<p>
	This one of my favorite books because it is about a girl<br /> who has fragile bones and how this makes certain<br /> tasks in her life more difficult. In addition, it shows how having a child with <br />a certain disability can result<br /> in the parent making decisions that wouldn't<br /> be made on a daily basis.<br />
