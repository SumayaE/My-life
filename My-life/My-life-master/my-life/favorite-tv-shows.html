	</p>
	<p>
	This show is about a group of FBI Agents who work <br />together to profile unsubs and solve murders. I like <br />this show because it walks you through the agent's <br />thought process and how they put together pieces to <br />solve a murder. In addition, it shows the balance of<br /> humor and seriousness in a workplace like this. <br />Finally, it shows the danger of this job and how it<br /> can have an impact on the family of the agent.<br />

	</p>
	<p>
	Grey's Anatomy is a show about group of doctors who <br />started off as surgical interns and how they become <br />who they are today. This is a great show because it <br />expresses the struggle of being surgeons and having a <br />personal life at the same time. In addition, it shows <br />how they manage a balance between work and home. <br />Finally, it shows how thi job can be stressful and <br />that sometimes you have to make quick and good <br />decisions in situations where time is running out.<br />

	<h2><u>Teen Wolf</u></h2><br />
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
	Teen Wolf is a supernatural show that is about a <br />teenager who was bit by a werewolf and how he tries <br />to protect the people he loves with his powers. I<br /> like this show because teaches that not all bad <br />people are evil and that there are some people who <br />may seem emotionless, deep in their heart they care.<br />
