	</p>.
	<p>
	This is one of my favorite books because it shows how hard it is<br /> for a child to be pressured into doing something they don't want.<br /> It also shows how one decision can impact many people at once.<br />
	</p>
	<h2><u>If I stay</u></h2><br />

	This is another one of my favorite because it is about a girl who<br />lost everything and was struggling with the decision of whether<br />she had anything worth living for anymore.It showed how hard it<br />was for her to make this decision and all the thoughts that came <br /> mind.<br />
	</p>.

	</p>
	<p>
	This one of my favorite books because it is about a girl who has<br />fragile bones and how this makes certain tasks in her life more<br /> difficult. In addition, it shows how having a child with a certain<br /> disability can result in the parent making decisions that wouldn't<br /> be made on a daily basis.<br />
